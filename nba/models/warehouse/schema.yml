    description: "**Business Summary:**\n\nThe business summary of the model explanation\
      \ is that the model calculates various statistics for basketball players based\
      \ on their game logs and salaries throughout the 2022-23 NBA season. This provides\
      \ a comprehensive set of statistics for each player, allowing for performance\
      \ analysis and comparisons.\n\n**Technical Summary:**\n\nThe dbt model shown\
      \ above calculates various statistics for basketball players based on their\
      \ game logs and salaries. \n\nThe model first creates a temporary table called\
      \ `playerstats` that aggregates the game statistics for each player. It calculates\
      \ the total minutes played, field goals made and attempted, three-point shots\
      \ made and attempted, free throws made and attempted, offensive and defensive\
      \ rebounds, total rebounds, assists, turnovers, steals, blocks, block attempts,\
      \ personal fouls, personal fouls drawn, points scored, plus-minus, games played,\
      \ and games missed.\n\nThe model then performs a join operation between the\
      \ `playerstats` table and a table called `source_player_salaries` to retrieve\
      \ the salary information for each player. It selects the player ID, player name,\
      \ 2022-23 salary, total minutes played, salary per minute played, salary per\
      \ game played, average field goal percentage, average three-point percentage,\
      \ average free throw percentage, total assists, average assists per game (calculated\
      \ using the average function), total turnovers, average turnovers per game,\
      \ total steals, total blocks, total block attempts, total personal fouls, total\
      \ personal fouls drawn, total points, average points per game, total plus-minus,\
      \ and average plus-minus (calculated using the average function).\n\nThe resulting\
      \ query provides a comprehensive set of statistics for each player, allowing\
      \ for performance analysis and comparisons."
