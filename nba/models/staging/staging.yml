    description: "**Business Summary:**\n\nThe business summary of the model explanation\
      \ above is that it describes the process of retrieving data from the `PLAYER_GAME_LOGS`\
      \ table in the `PUBLIC` schema and performing various transformations on the\
      \ data. The transformations include renaming columns, converting date format,\
      \ rounding minutes played, and performing additional calculations. The model\
      \ then selects all the transformed columns as the output.\n\n**Technical Summary:**\n\
      \nThe dbt (data build tool) model outlined above consists of two stages: `source`\
      \ and `renamed`. \n\nIn the `source` stage, the model retrieves data from the\
      \ `PLAYER_GAME_LOGS` table in the `PUBLIC` schema. The retrieved data is then\
      \ used as the input for the next stage.\n\nIn the `renamed` stage, the model\
      \ performs various transformations on the data. It renames some of the columns\
      \ to more descriptive names, converts the `GAME_DATE` column to the format `YYYY-MM-DD`,\
      \ and rounds the `MIN` (minutes played) column to two decimal places. It also\
      \ renames some other columns and performs additional calculations on the data.\n\
      \nFinally, the model selects all columns from the `renamed` stage and returns\
      \ them as the output."

    description: "**Business Summary:**\n\nThe business summary of the model explanation\
      \ is that it is a dbt (data build tool) model that is used to source data from\
      \ a table called `GAMES` in the `PUBLIC` schema. The model then transforms and\

      \n**Technical Summary:**\n\nThe model defined above is a dbt (data build tool)\
      \ model. It has two steps: `source` and `renamed`. \n\nIn the `source` step,\
      \ data is sourced from a table named `GAMES` in the schema `PUBLIC`. The source()\
      \ function is a dbt macro that helps in sourcing data from various databases.\n\
      \nIn the `renamed` step, the data from the `source` step is transformed and\
      \ renamed. The column names are modified to make them more understandable. For\
      \ example, the column `season_id` remains the same, but other columns like `team_id`\
      \ are renamed as `team_abbreviation` to represent the team's abbreviated name.\n\
      \nAfter the transformation, all the columns from the `renamed` step are selected\
      \ and returned in the final output.\n\nThis dbt model can be used to load and\
      \ transform data from the `GAMES` table in the `PUBLIC` schema, and rename the\
      \ columns for better readability and understanding."

    description: "**Business Summary:**\n\nThe business summary of the model explanation\
      \ is that the code represents a dbt model, which is a process for transforming\
      \ and preparing data in a data warehouse. This model has two stages of transformations\
      \ - the `source` stage and the `renamed` stage. The `source` stage selects all\
      \ columns from a table called `COMMON_PLAYER_INFO` in the `PUBLIC` schema. The\
      \ `renamed` stage further transforms the data by renaming columns and performing\
      \ calculations or conversions. The final transformed data is selected from the\
      \ `renamed` stage. In summary, this dbt model takes data from a specific table,\
      \ applies transformations, and outputs the final transformed data.\n\n**Technical\
      \ Summary:**\n\nThe above code represents the dbt model, which is a process\
      \ for transforming and preparing data in a data warehouse. In this model, we\
      \ have two stages of transformations.\n\nThe first stage is the `source` stage,\
      \ which selects all columns from a table named `COMMON_PLAYER_INFO` in the `PUBLIC`\
      \ schema. The `source` stage acts as the input for the next stage.\n\nIn the\
      \ second stage, the `renamed` stage, we further transform the data by selecting\
      \ specific columns from the `source` stage and performing some calculations\
      \ or renaming columns. \n\nFor example, we rename the column `display_first_last`\
      \ as `full_name` and calculate the `height_in_inches` by converting the height\
      \ from feet-inches format to inches. We also rename some other columns and perform\
      \ some simple calculations or conversions.\n\nFinally, in the last part of the\
      \ code, we select all columns from the `renamed` stage, which represents the\
      \ final transformed data.\n\nOverall, this dbt model takes data from the `COMMON_PLAYER_INFO`\
      \ table, applies some transformations, and outputs the final transformed data."

    description: "**Business Summary:**\n\nThe business summary of the model explanation\
      \ is that the model performs transformations on data from the `PUBLIC.TEAM_SALARIES`\
      \ source table. It creates temporary tables, renames columns, and returns the\
      \ transformed data as the final output.\n\n**Technical Summary:**\n\nThis dbt\
      \ model performs the following actions:\n\n1. It starts by creating a temporary\
      \ table called `source` using the data from the `PUBLIC.TEAM_SALARIES` source\
      \ table. The `source` table represents the initial dataset for further transformations.\n\
      \n2. Next, it creates a temporary table called `renamed` by selecting specific\
      \ columns from the `source` table and renaming them. The columns `Team`, `Total\
      \ Cap`, and `Luxury Tax Bill` are renamed to `full_name`, `total_cap`, and `luxury_tax_bill`,\
      \ respectively.\n\n3. Finally, it selects all columns from the `renamed` table\
      \ and returns them as the final output of the dbt model.\n\nOverall, this model\
      \ fetches data from the `PUBLIC.TEAM_SALARIES` table, renames certain columns,\
      \ and presents the transformed data as the final result."
