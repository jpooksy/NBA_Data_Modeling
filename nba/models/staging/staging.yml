    description: "**Business Summary:**\n\nThe business summary of the model explanation\
      \ above is that it describes the process of retrieving data from the `PLAYER_GAME_LOGS`\
      \ table in the `PUBLIC` schema and performing various transformations on the\
      \ data. The transformations include renaming columns, converting date format,\
      \ rounding minutes played, and performing additional calculations. The model\
      \ then selects all the transformed columns as the output.\n\n**Technical Summary:**\n\
      \nThe dbt (data build tool) model outlined above consists of two stages: `source`\
      \ and `renamed`. \n\nIn the `source` stage, the model retrieves data from the\
      \ `PLAYER_GAME_LOGS` table in the `PUBLIC` schema. The retrieved data is then\
      \ used as the input for the next stage.\n\nIn the `renamed` stage, the model\
      \ performs various transformations on the data. It renames some of the columns\
      \ to more descriptive names, converts the `GAME_DATE` column to the format `YYYY-MM-DD`,\
      \ and rounds the `MIN` (minutes played) column to two decimal places. It also\
      \ renames some other columns and performs additional calculations on the data.\n\
      \nFinally, the model selects all columns from the `renamed` stage and returns\
      \ them as the output."

    description: "**Business Summary:**\n\nThe business summary of the model explanation\
      \ is that it is a dbt (data build tool) model that is used to source data from\
      \ a table called `GAMES` in the `PUBLIC` schema. The model then transforms and\
      \ renames the columns to improve readability and understanding. The final output\
      \ includes all the columns from the transformed step. This model can be used\

      \n**Technical Summary:**\n\nThe model defined above is a dbt (data build tool)\
      \ model. It has two steps: `source` and `renamed`. \n\nIn the `source` step,\
      \ data is sourced from a table named `GAMES` in the schema `PUBLIC`. The source()\
      \ function is a dbt macro that helps in sourcing data from various databases.\n\
      \nIn the `renamed` step, the data from the `source` step is transformed and\
      \ renamed. The column names are modified to make them more understandable. For\
      \ example, the column `season_id` remains the same, but other columns like `team_id`\
      \ are renamed as `team_abbreviation` to represent the team's abbreviated name.\n\
      \nAfter the transformation, all the columns from the `renamed` step are selected\
      \ and returned in the final output.\n\nThis dbt model can be used to load and\
      \ transform data from the `GAMES` table in the `PUBLIC` schema, and rename the\
      \ columns for better readability and understanding."
